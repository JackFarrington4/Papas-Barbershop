# Papas-Barbershop
Here is a basic website for a friends Barbershop. I was unable to get pictures of his team so thought I'd throw in some familiar faces instead! Happy to take any advice or constructive criticism, please be nice as I'm only 22% through my course:) Also, I am yet to apply the flex attributes so it will be for desktop only for now:) Thanks
